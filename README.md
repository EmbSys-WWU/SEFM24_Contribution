# RAID24_Contribution

This reproduction package contains the prototypical implementation of our approach to leverage symbolic execution for precise information flow analysis of timed concurrent systems.

All examples are contained in the examples directory. Executing the provided JAR file runs the analysis on all these examples, printing some results into the console while providing a more detailed report in Report.txt files in the respective directories. Pregenerated reports are already present.
