# RAID24_Contribution

This reproduction package contains the prototypical implementation of our approach to leverage symbolic execution for precise information flow analysis of timed concurrent systems.

All examples are contained in the examples directory. Executing the provided JAR file (requires Java 21 or newer) runs the analysis on all these examples, printing some results into the console while providing a more detailed report for each example in a Report.txt file in the respective directory. Pregenerated reports are already present. As anonymous.4open.science does not allow for downloading the entire repository, we also provide a zip file that allows for successfull execution of the JAR when extracted in the same directory.

Due to issues with the anonymization procedure of anonymous.4open.science, copyright headers had to be removed manually. Nontheless, all parts of this software are under copyright protection. Any distribution this software or any parts thereof, modified or unmodified, is prohibited. All rights reserved.
